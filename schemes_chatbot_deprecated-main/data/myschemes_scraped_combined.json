There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed \u20b975,000.\n\nConstruction of Common Facility\nThis government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within \u20b92 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.\n\nAssurance of Clean Drinking Water\nThis scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.\n\nInsurance Facility\n(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory \u20b950,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides \u20b925,000 for partial permanent disability.\n\nHere, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth \u20b915 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.\n\nOn the other hand, those States/UT\u2019s, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT\u2019s.\n\nSaving cum relief\nThe National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects \u20b975 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total \u20b9600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth \u20b9600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month.

There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. \nii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. \niii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\n\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. \n\nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years\niv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\n\nHouseholds with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\n\nNote: To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.\n\nEarmarking of Targets - \n\nFor SC/ST:\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\n\nFor Minorities:\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\n\nFor PwDs:\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\n\nTie Breaker\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\n\ni. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii. Households with a single girl child.\niv.

It has the purpose of accessing most financial services for citizens and making it simple for them. These include basic deposit and savings accounts, credit, remittance, pension, insurance, and others available with an inexpensive pay range.

It can have an inbuilt insurance cover worth \u20b9100,000. Moreover, it also includes an overdraft facility of up to \u20b95,000.

Under the scheme, Consumers will pay the market price for the domestic cylinder and the subsidy will be transferred directly to their bank account. This removes the incentive to divert the domestic LPG cylinders, which moved in the supply chain at almost half of their real market price.\n\nBefore PAHAL, the LPG supply chain was opaque and LPG consumers were powerless and were at the mercy of the distributors in a monopoly market structure. The government on the one hand wanted to overcome these obstacles and deliver good services to citizens and on the other hand, wanted to reduce their subsidy burden by curbing the diversion of subsidized cylinders meant for domestic consumers into the commercial market. \n\nTo infuse transparency and efficiency into the supply chain of LPG, a framework was needed which would lead to better management of subsidies and a reduction in the burden on the exchequer. Hence, the government decided to launch PAHAL or Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL) scheme for LPG consumers across the country. PAHAL solves the twin problems of lack of accountability leading to poor consumer service and diversion leading to leakages in LPG subsidy.\n\nPAHAL (DBTL) was designed to ensure that the benefit meant for the genuine domestic customer reaches them directly and is not diverted. PAHAL (DBTL) also ensures that precious public money is saved by eliminating diversion. Further, LPG customers who do not wish to avail of the LPG subsidy can choose to Opt out of the subsidy using \"Form 5\" which can be submitted to the distributor. Consumers can also register and exercise this option by visiting www.MyLPG.in and accessing OMC\u2019s portals. Around 9000 citizens have already voluntarily given up the LPG subsidy so far.\n\nThe DBTL scheme was rolled out in 291 districts in the country from 1st June 2013 in six phases. The scheme covered nearly 10 crore consumers and over 3770 distributors across the three PSU Oil Marketing Companies. The DBTL scheme launched earlier required the LPG consumer to mandatorily have an Aadhaar number for availing LPG subsidy. The modified scheme has been re-launched in 54 districts on 15.11.2014 in the 1st phase and in the rest of the country on 01.01.2015. This not only will prevent diversion but also will allow us to detect duplicate connections against the same individual. Under the modified DBTL scheme (PAHAL), in effect now, each LPG consumer will link his Aadhaar number in the LPG database and in the bank account database, and then the subsidy will be routed to the individual bank accounts in accordance with the delivery of LPG cylinders. Alternatively, LPG consumers who do not have an Aadhaar number can also get subsidies into their bank account by simply linking their Bank Account with their LPG database. \n\nSuch a consumer will be called Cash Transfer Compliant (CTC) once he/she joins the scheme and is ready to receive a subsidy in his/her bank account. The LPG consumers who had already joined the scheme earlier and had received the cash subsidy in their bank accounts do not need to do anything further. To confirm this they can either contact their LPG distributor or visit www.mylpg.in and access the individual OMC\u2019s portals. Such consumers will start getting the LPG subsidy directly into their bank account as soon as the scheme is launched in their district. \n\nThose consumers who didn\u2019t join the scheme earlier but have their Aadhaar number with them can join the scheme and become CTC by getting the same seeded with their LPG distributor as well as with their banks. For those who are not yet enrolled with UIDAI and don\u2019t have an Aadhaar number can also join the scheme and become CTC by getting their bank details seeded into the LPG database. \n\nObjectives - \nThe following are the key objectives of the scheme - \na) Remove incentive for diversion. \nb) Protect entitlement and ensure subsidy to the consumer. \nc) Improve the availability/delivery of LPG cylinders for genuine users \nd) Weed out fake/duplicate connections \ne) Allow Self Selection in subsidy ", "benefits": "Benefits\nA.
